# Clockwork Gardener

Clockwork Gardener is a historical fiction puzzle RPG that engages players through exploring the locations, a distinctive combat system, and a compelling narrative. Set in 1930 the game follows Cerda Cono (player), who is in search of her long lost son who she believes is trapped in one the mysterious “time” capsules deep in the woods throughout the forests of the Americas. These time capsules are known as Garden Gates and are made by an enigmatic group known as the Order. These Garden Gates trap prisoners for hundreds of years leaving them isolated and alone. The purpose of this is not well understood, but Cerda knows that is meant as a punishment for those that the Order deems to be criminals. Each gate is protected by a high ranking member of the Order and represents the boss at the end of each level. Cerda will also run into other members of the Order as she travels throughout North and South America, and these represent the common enemies in the game. When combat occurs the screen will switch to puzzle, wherein, the player will need to secure a certain number of points in a set time period. Cerda will travel to different geographic locations, which will represent levels. As Cerda travels the levels map triggers will cause dialog boxes to pop up. These dialog boxes represent Cerda’s internal dialogue as she remembers aspects of her life, and reveals the lore behind the game. At the end of these levels Cerda will face a boss and upon defeating them be allowed in the Garden Gate. She will be faced with the task of talking with the prisoner and deciding if they should live. These decisions will have ramifications for the end of the game. Exploring moral themes and creating a situation where the player has to truly contemplate their actions in a larger context will make Clockwork Gardener unique among RPGs, which are often morally reductionist and lack sociopolitical reflection.
