Cerda: Two decades in this gods forsaken jungle.
Cerda: Where is that damn gate?
Cerda: Wu'a! Back at Shingu...
Cerda: Is that... a trail! Would the gate keepers be so sloppy as to leave blatant tracks?
Cerda: An ambush! Those fuckers! I must be getting close now.
Cerda: I'll see you soon Juan...
Cerda: What's that noise ahead?
Cerda: This gate will be the one, I can feel it.
Cerda: I should temper my hope, it's been numerous centuries and I've seen dozens of gates, and every single one of those just contained some prick or another.
Cerda: So many wicked souls...
Cerda: Sigh.
Voice in the woods: I SEE YOU CERDA.
...
Voice in the woods: COME INTO THE WOODS AND PLAY.
Cerda: The jungle is ending, and is that...?
Cerda: A BRIDGE!
Cerda: And it's broken... who built this anyways?
Cerda: Oh well, I better follow the river and look for another way across.
Cerda:  What the hell is wrong with the water ahead? I can't see the shore line?
Cerda: A trick bridge? Clever.
Cerda: All of these dead trees... I must be getting close.
Cerda: I'll see you soon my son... but... why can't I remember his name...
Voice in the bramble: COME HERE YOU DEMON.
Voice in the bramble: YOU MAY HAVE BEAT THE OTHER GUARDIANS, BUT YOU WON'T BEAT ME ANCIENT ONE.
Cerda: Who the fuck are you? You aren't my son.
Percy Fawcett: Excuse yourself madam. I'm Dr. Fawcett and I'd appreciate if you could tell me where the damn hell I am.
Cerda: A garden gate, trapped in time... And judging by your clothes I'd say you've been here for about a decade.
Percy Fawcett: What...I... I don't remember anything...how... Dear god, my family, my research... Who would do this?
Percy Fawcett: Dear god, my family, my research... Who would do this?
Cerda: The guardians, they usually imprison men lost in the woods. What were you doing out here anyways?
Percy Fawcett: I was just researching the 'Lost City Of Z', but these savages hid it well.
Cerda: Savages? This makes my decision easier. Let me give you back to the woods.
